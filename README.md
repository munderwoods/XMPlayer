# XMPlayer

This is a simple in-browser player for XM files ONLY. XM is a format used for chiptune music classically composed in the FastTracker 2 sequencer. MilkeyTracker is a good modern alternative.

This uses the ft2 library which was reverse-engineered by a1k0n.

Some changes have been made by Casey Clyde to the library for more accurate effects for files created in MilkyTracker.
